The following Quickstart uses an embedded notebook hosted by Deepnote so you can try out Weights & Biases without setting up an environment on your local machine.

This example uses [the MNIST database of handwritten digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) to train a handwriting recognition model. After providing your API key and running the notebook, you will get live URLs to explore the Weights & Biases dashboard and observe what happened during training.
